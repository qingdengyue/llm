The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

My son has been in the 3 year old class since September '11 and has had the very same teachers the whole time.  They are both educated and caring and provide a fun, safe environment for the children in their class.  They really go above and beyond to provide activities that support weekly themes, etc.  This week in honor of the 4th of July they are tie-dying shirts in red, white and blue.  This sort of environment is generally driven top down and the director of the school sets a good example of both high expectations and approachability.

This used to be the home of Guthrie's Chicken and although my husband was a fan, I was not sad to see it go. After reading some reviews I decided to give this place a shot. I do like the fact that you can place your order ahead of time through the eat24 website, in addition to having a drive thru if you're feeling extra lazy or are on the go. My complaint about their menu on the eat24 website is that there is no description of the wing sauce flavors. So I can choose the \\\"voodoo\\\" flavor, but what is it? In any case, we opted for six voodoo wings, six hot and sweet, and an order of garlic parmesan bayou bites (boneless). The voodoo is suppose to be a mix of sriracha and soy sauce, but it did not have too much flavor. Hot and sweet was kind of like mango habanero at BWW with much less heat. The bayou bites flavor was good but they were super greasy.\\n\\nI think the price point is right for the mass produced on the go wings -- it is $4.99 for six wings. The sides they offer are pretty limited and to the point consisting of fries, fried pickles, and cole slaw. I would rate this joint well below Buffalo Wild Wings in flavor and quality, but are a decent option if you are on the go and are craving some wings.</td>\n",
